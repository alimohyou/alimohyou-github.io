									<h1>information of
										Things</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
								The Internet of Things, or IoT, is the collective term for the network of interconnected gadgets
								 as well as the technology that enables communication between devices and the cloud. As a result
								  of the development of low-cost computer chips and high-bandwidth connection, billions of devices
								   are currently online. This implies that commonplace appliances like vacuums, vehicles, machinery,
								    and toothbrushes can employ sensors to gather information and react to users intelligently. 
									<h2>How does IoT work?</h2>
									U need a device, IoT application and a GUI. A device gathers information from its surroundings, user inputs,
									or usage patterns, then transmits that information to and from its Internet of Things application via the internet. 
									An Internet of Things application is a group of programmes and services that combines information from different IoT devices.
									It analyses this data and makes defensible conclusions using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies.
									The Internet of Things device receives these judgements back and reacts intelligently to further inputs. 
									A graphical user interface can be used to manage an IoT device or fleet of devices. Examples that are frequently
									 given are websites or mobile applications that allow users to register and manage smart devices. <br><br>
									 <h2>Industrial IoT</h2>
									The term "industrial IoT" (IIoT) describes smart devices that are used to increase company efficiency in manufacturing,
									retail, healthcare, and other industries. Industrial equipment and sensors provide business owners with comprehensive,
									real-time data that may be leveraged to enhance operational procedures. They offer insights on production, logistics,
									supply chain management, and human resources with the goal of lowering costs and generating more income.
									Industrial systemm has different verticals such as manufacture, automobile, medical sciences, logistics and transport. 
									<h2>Smart Cities</h2>
									A smart city is a local government that makes use of information and communication technology (ICT) to boost public 
									information sharing, boost operational efficiency, and enhance the standard of citizen welfare and government services.<br>
									User interfaces (UI), communication networks, software, and internet of things (IoT) devices are all used in smart cities.
									 But they mostly rely on the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected objects that 
									 can exchange data and communicate, including home appliances, cars, and sensors. Servers or the cloud hold the data that 
									 is gathered and sent by IoT sensors and devices. Through the use of data analytics (DA) and device connectivity,
									  the physical and digital city aspects can more easily come together, resulting in increased efficiency for the public
									   and commercial sectors, potential economic gains, and improved quality of life for citizens.<br><br>

									   I have learned so far that IoT is all about sensing, responding and reaction. IoT consists of
									   devices that should be  sensing, connecting, active and smart. With the help of cloud you can collect 
									   and analyse data from IoT devices. In order to access data view in processed cloud, you need to have a client
									   application. Lastly, IoT is decentralised.
