									<h1>What is<br />
									cybersecurity</h1>
									<i>“for every action to store, secure, and use data, there is an equal or greater reaction to steal data”<br><b>Leah VanSyckel</b></i>
								</header>
								<p>Protecting computer systems and networks from malicious actor attacks that could lead to
									unauthorised information disclosure, theft of, or damage to hardware, software, or data,
									 as well as disruption or misdirection of the services they provide, is known as computer security,
									  cybersecurity, digital security, or information technology security (IT security)</p>
									  <h2>Fundimentals of Cybersecurity</h2>
									  <h3><u>CIA Triad</u></h3>
									  <p>The creation of security systems is often based on a common concept called the CIA triad.
										 They function as tools for identifying weak points and developing workarounds. 
										 Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are the three letters that make up the "CIA triad".<br>
										 <div class="image main"><img src="images/Cia.jpg" alt="" /></div>
										<h4>Confidentiality:</h4>This security concept addresses restricted access to data. Its purpose is to guarantee that only authorised individuals have access to sensitive data, preventing unauthorised individuals from doing so.<br><br>
										<h4>Integrity:</h4>To maintain integrity, sensitive material must not be changed while in transit. To prevent unauthorised people from changing it, security precautions like file permissions and user access restrictions should be implemented.<br><br>
										<h4>Availability:</h4>The accessibility principle ensures that allowed users may access sensitive data with consistency and dependability. This entails keeping up with the systems, hardware, and technological infrastructure that store and show the data.<br><br>
										 </p><hr>
										<h3><u>AAA Security</u></h3>
										<p>A security architecture known as authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) regulates access to computer resources,
											 upholds rules, and audits usage. By vetting users and monitoring their online behaviour, AAA and its allied procedures are essential to network management and cybersecurity.
											<h4>Authentication:</h4>A user must provide personal information in order to be authenticated. Users verify their identity by presenting their login credentials. 
											A AAA server is an identity and access management (IAM) tool that verifies that a user's login, password, and other authentication tools match those in its database of saved credentials.
											Three different forms of authentication exist: something you own, like a USB key, something you know, like a password, and something you are, like your fingerprint or other biometrics.<br><br>
											<h4>authorization:</h4>Authentication is followed by authorization. A user may be given access privileges to particular parts of a network or system during authorization. 
											A database contains the user's identify as well as the locations and permission sets that have been given to them. 
											An administrator has the ability to modify a user's privileges.
											Authorization is distinct from authentication in that the former determines the user's permissible actions, while the latter just verifies the user's identity.<br>
											An employee in the IT department, for instance, could not have the authority to alter the passwords for a virtual private network (VPN) used by the entire organisation.
											On the other hand, the network administrator has the option to provide the member access rights, which would allow them to change each user's VPN password.
											The team member will be granted permission to enter a previously inaccessible region in this way.<br><br>
											<h4>accounting</h4>Accounting monitors user behaviour on a network by recording details about the user's IP address, the services they accessed,
											the data they sent and received, the length of time they spent logged in, and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) they used.<br>
											Accounting may be used to audit user behaviour, analyse user patterns, and produce more precise pricing. Utilising the information gathered during the user's access will enable this.
											For instance, if the system bills users by the hour, the accounting system's time records can indicate how long a user spent inside the system and logged into the router, allowing the system to bill them appropriately. <br><br>

										<h3><u>Risk Assessment</u></h3>
										<p>The process of locating, assessing, and evaluating any risks, threats, and vulnerabilities as well as their possible effects on an organization's data, information systems, and overall security posture is known as risk assessment in cybersecurity.
											 It's an essential first step in putting in place reliable cybersecurity defences and reducing possible risks.<br>
											 <div class="image main"><img src="images/risk assessment.png" alt="" /></div>
											 <ul>Process of Risk Assessment are:<br>
												<li>Risk Identification</li>
												<li>Risk Analysis</li>
												<li>Risk Evaluation:</li>
												<li>Risk Mitigation</li>
												<li>Risk Monitoring and Review</li>
											 </ul>
											</p><hr>
										 <h3><u>Cyber Kill Chain Model</u></h3>
										 <p>The cyber death chain is a sequence of actions that tracks the evolution of a cyberattack from initial reconnaissance to data exfiltration. 
											The kill chain aids in our comprehension and defence against advanced persistent threats (APTs), ransomware, and security lapses.<br>
											<h4>Reconnaissance:</h4>The observation stage, to choose targets and assault strategies, attackers usually evaluate the situation from the outside in.<br><br>
											<h4>Weaponization:</h4>The phase in which the attacker produces or gets hold of a hostile payload, such malware or a document that has been weaponized.<br><br>
											<h4>Delivery:</h4>The procedure of contact that is used to deliver an attack to a specific device.<br><br>
											<h4>Exploitation:</h4>Phase where adversary target system's vulnerability.<br><br>
											<h4>Installation:</h4>Attack delivered by a successful exploitation.<br><br>
											<h4>Command and Control:</h4>When attacker have aquires access to targeted system components or network<br><br>
											<h4>Incident response:</h4>Process and tools used to defend against an attack.<br><br>
											<hr>
										</p>
										<h3><u>STRIDE</u></h3>
										<p>A methodology called STRIDE is used to detect risks to computer security. It offers a six-category categorization for security concerns.</p>
										<table>
											<!-- Table Header -->
											<thead>
											  <tr>
												<th></th>
												<th>Threat</th>
												<th>Violation</th>
										
											  </tr>
											</thead>
											<!-- Table Body -->
											<tbody>
											  <!-- Row 1 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>S</td>
												<td>spoofing identity</td>
												<td>Authentication</td>
											  </tr>
											  <!-- Row 2 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>T</td>
												<td>Tampering with data</td>
												<td>Integrity</td>
											  </tr>
											  <!-- Row 3 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>R</td>

											  </tr>
											  <!-- Row 6 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>E</td>
												<td>Elevation of privilage</td>
												<td>Authorization</td>
											  </tr>
											</tbody>
										  </table><hr>

										  <h3><u>DREAD</u></h3>
										  <p>DREAD is a component of a system that evaluates the risk of cyber security threats. 
											It offers a framework for classifying security risks into five risk categories.<br><br>
										  </p>
										  <table>
											<!-- Table Header -->
											<thead>
											  <tr>
												<th></th>
												<th>Category</th>
												<th>Exploitation</th>
										
											  </tr>
											</thead>
											<!-- Table Body -->
											<tbody>
											  <!-- Row 1 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>D</td>
												<td>Damage potential</td>
												<td>How great is the damage?</td>
											  </tr>
											  <!-- Row 2 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>R</td>
												<td>Reproducibility</td>
												<td>Is it easy to reproduce?</td>
											  </tr>
											  <!-- Row 3 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>E</td>
												<td>Exploitability</td>
												<td>Is it easy to launch?</td>
											  </tr>
											  <!-- Row 4 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>A</td>
												<td>Affected user</td>
												<td>Number of users affected?</td>
											  </tr>
											  <!-- Row 5 -->
											  <tr>
												<td>D</td>
												<td>Discoverability</td>
												<td>Is it easy to find a vulnerability?</td>
											  </tr>
											</tbody></table>
