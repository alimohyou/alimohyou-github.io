									<h1>Digitalization</h1>
								</header>
								<p>The way businesses run and engage with their customers has been drastically changed by the
                                     digital economy, which has also brought about a number of positive effects like more 
                                     convenience, efficiency, and creativity. But this move to a more digital economy has 
                                     also meant increased security concerns, especially with regard to cyberthreats and weaknesses.
                                      I will analyse the security implications of the digital economy in this answer using the writings
                                       of Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic (2018) as a basis, along with my personal 
                                       observations and ideas.<br><br>
                                       An important cyber security issue that comes with becoming a completely digital organisation is
                                        the higher danger of cyberattacks. According to Spremic and Simunic (2018), organisations are now 
                                        more susceptible to cyberthreats like ransomware attacks, malware, and hacking since business processes
                                         and data are becoming more digitalized. Furthermore, because digital systems are interconnected, a single
                                          breach may have far-reaching effects and can impact a huge number of stakeholders.<br><br>
                                          There exist supplementary cyber security obstacles for a physical small and medium-sized firm (SME)
                                           seeking to transition into a digital enterprise. These could include the requirement to purchase new
                                            hardware and software in order to support digital operations, as well as a lack of technical know-how 
                                            and resources. These difficulties might be especially severe for smaller businesses since they do not 
                                            have the same resources and finance as larger corporations, as noted by Spremic and Simunic (2018).<br><br>
                                            In a nutshell, the digital economy has significantly benefited businesses and created new opportunities,
                                             but it has also resulted in new security implications and concerns. The implementation of strong security
                                              measures across all organisational aspects is necessary for a completely digital firm, as it presents more 
                                              cyber security concerns. Becoming a digital firm can be especially difficult for brick and mortar SMEs, and 
                                              more resources and knowledge could be required to make sure that security concerns are adequately handled. 
                                              Lastly, given the current energy crisis, it's critical to weigh the advantages of the digital transformation
                                               against the need to cut back on energy use and lessen environmental effect, as well as the sustainability of
                                                the digital economy.</p>
